Ever wondered just how many points the game used to generate a raid? Are you getting the maximum 10,000 point raids yet? Now you'll know because you can see exactly how many raid points are used to generate every raid and many other types of incidents.

For an even more educational experience, you can also enable a threat points breakdown that shows the details of how the points were calculated, line by line. This option must be turned on in the mod settings first and will not work and/or make sense with mods that alter the way threat points are calculated.

Note: The current version of this mod is no longer compatible with version 1.2 of the game. For a 1.2-compatible version of the mod with reduced functionality, you can download it from the "1.2-compatibility" branch on GitHub: https://github.com/1trickPonyta/VisibleRaidPoints/tree/1.2-compatibility

Note: The threat points breakdown feature of this mod is not compatibile with my other mod, Unlimited Threat Scale (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2562732435). For a compatibile version of the mod, you can download it from the "uts-compatibility" branch on GitHub: https://github.com/1trickPwnyta/VisibleRaidPoints/tree/uts-compatibility You will also need to download the compatible version of Unlimited Threat Scale at https://github.com/1trickPwnyta/UnlimitedThreatScale/tree/vrp-compatibility
